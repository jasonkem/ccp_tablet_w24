            <h3>Steps to make Chicken Parm</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pound the chicken breasts to even thickness (about ½ inch thick) for even cooking. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes:
                    Dish 1: Flour seasoned with salt and pepper.
                    Dish 2: Eggs beaten with 1 tablespoon of water.
                    Dish 3: Breadcrumbs mixed with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
                <li>Dredge each chicken breast in flour, shaking off excess, then dip in the egg mixture, and finally coat with the breadcrumb mixture.</li>
                <li>Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Fry the chicken until golden brown on each side (about 3-4 minutes per side). The chicken doesn't need to be cooked through at this stage.</li>
                <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Spoon some marinara sauce into the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place the fried chicken breasts over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spoon more marinara sauce over each chicken breast.</li>
                <li>Top each with a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the cheese is bubbly and slightly golden.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves for a burst of color and freshness.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, ideally with a side of pasta, spaghetti, or a crisp salad.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Marinated Salmon</h2>

            <p>[Salmon]</p>
            <h3>Steps to make Marinated Salmon</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice, minced garlic, grated ginger, Dijon mustard, and honey (if using) until well combined.</li>
                <li>Season the marinade with salt and pepper according to your taste.</li>
                <li>Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag.</li>
                <li>Pour the marinade over the salmon, ensuring each fillet is well coated.</li>
                <li>Cover or seal and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for a stronger flavor. Avoid marinating for too long, as the acid in the marinade can start to break down the fish.</li>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) or prepare your grill if you prefer grilled salmon.</li>
                <li>Remove the salmon from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for about 10-15 minutes before cooking.</li>
                <li>Heat the grill to medium-high heat. Grill the salmon skin-side down for about 6-8 minutes, then flip and grill for an additional 3-4 minutes or until desired doneness.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, transfer the salmon to a serving platter.</li>
                <li>You can drizzle some of the cooked marinade over the salmon for extra flavor.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh herbs like dill or parsley for a fresh and appealing presentation.</li>
                <li>Serve the marinated salmon with a side of your choice, such as steamed vegetables, rice, or a fresh salad.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions and form them into patties. The patties should be about the size of your buns.</li>
