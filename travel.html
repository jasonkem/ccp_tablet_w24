            <img src="images/la-latina-madrid.jpg" width="400" alt="Photo of La Latina, Madrid, Spain">
            <p>Last semester I studied abroad in Madrid, Spain. I lived in the La Latina neighborhood in an 8 person flat. 3 of my roommates were from Umich, 2 from Spain, one from France, and the last one from Italy. I loved my time in Spain and thought that La Latina was the perfect location for me.</p>
